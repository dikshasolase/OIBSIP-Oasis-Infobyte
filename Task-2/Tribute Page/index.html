    <h2>Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h2>

    <p>
        Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was an eminent Indian scientist and the 11th President of India.
        He is popularly known as the <strong>“Missile Man of India”</strong> for his outstanding
        contributions to the development of ballistic missile and launch vehicle technology.
    </p>

    <p>
        Born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, he came from a humble background.
        Through hard work, dedication, and perseverance, he became one of the most respected
        personalities in the country.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I admire most about Dr. Kalam is his simplicity, discipline, and love for education.
        He strongly believed that students are the future of the nation and always encouraged
        young people to dream big and work hard to achieve their goals.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even after becoming the President of India, he lived a simple life and dedicated his
        time to teaching and motivating students. His life is a perfect example of how knowledge,
        humility, and positive thinking can change the world.
